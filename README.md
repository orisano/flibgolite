### CURRENT STABLE RELEASE v2.1.0

### *Attention users of version 1 !!!*   
The version 2 update has some improvements to the index structure, configuration and localization. Therefore, to switch to version 2, you should uninstall the version 1 service and install the version 2 service from scratch. Rendexing of the book stock of version 2 is drastically faster than in version 1, especially for FB2 archives, so the transition to version 2 can be completed with acceptable service downtime.
